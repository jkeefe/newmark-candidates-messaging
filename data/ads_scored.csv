March 31st was the fifteen year anniversary of the starvation and dehydration death of Terri Schiavo. Terri‚Äôs tragic case was national news for many days as Americans watched her slowly die in a St. Petersburg, FL hospital. Terri, age 42, was in a long-term vegetative state, but could respond to people. Her loving parents and brother vigorously attempted to take her home and care for her, but her husband claimed that she would have preferred to, in fact, die. Challenged in court several times, Florida law repeatedly gave the husband the legal authority to act on behalf of his disabled wife. The Florida Legislature and the US Congress both acted passing laws to protect Terri, but the courts over-ruled them.

America watched and waited. With each passing day, Terri got weaker and weaker from lack of food and water. Finally, Terri‚Äôs weakened body succumbed and her devoted family buried their daughter and sister knowing the pain and suffering she endured in her final days.  

Being pro-life means standing up for those that cannot stand up for themselves, from conception through natural death. This was voted on in the United States Congress and all of America watched. I would have voted in Congress to save Terri.

 In a Twitter rant this morning, Rep. Sean Casten (IL-06) accuses almost everyone for making the COVID-19 crisis worse. In the thread, he casts blame on the President, the media, social media platforms, social media users, and - despite repeatedly claiming his rant was non-political - Republicans, the Koch Brothers and the NRA. 

‚ÄúThese tweets are appalling. Blaming the world for problems instead of working to solve them shows us Sean Casten‚Äôs true character,‚Äù said Jeanne Ives, Republican nominee for Congress (IL-06) ‚ÄúOver the past two weeks, we have seen families and neighbors finding new and creative ways to look out for each other. I have talked with business owners in anguish  - not over their own circumstances, but over the uncertainty their employees are now faced with. We have seen doctors, nurses and infectious disease experts working overtime to help meet the needs in their communities. 

‚ÄúPeople are working together to find solutions that will make life better, and to make the best of an unprecedented and stressful situation. We expect our elected representatives to do the same. But, in a moment that leaders should be using their platforms to promote solutions and safety, Sean Casten stokes anger, fear, division and bitterness.

"Senator Brandon Beach announced Wednesday evening that he had been informed by his doctor that he tested positive for COVID-19 on. Beach immediately informed his colleagues and followed all guidelines set forth by Governor Kemp, the CDC, and other health officials. Unfortunately, some have decided to misrepresent the facts in a blatant and ugly effort to cause political harm to Senator Beach.

Certain individuals with their own political agenda have misrepresented the timeline of events and the facts about the health of Senator Beach leading up to the diagnosis.

Beach said: ‚ÄúHere are the facts: on Saturday, March 14th, I was cleared by my doctor to resume my official duties and presented with no reason to believe I had COVID-19 or any other serious illness. I followed the advice of my doctor that did not include actions such as quarantine related to the treatment of COVID-19. It is disappointing that some have chosen to misrepresent and manipulate the facts regarding private conversations I had with my doctor. It is outrageous and cowardly to allege that I would intentionally put my colleagues, friends, staff, and family at risk of contracting this virus.‚Äù

He continued: ‚ÄúIn a time of crisis, some choose to make false accusations and spread untruths. But it is wrong and harmful to make assumptions about an individual‚Äôs health or medical conditions before knowing all the facts.‚Äù.

Beach reported that he went to a doctor on Saturday for complications from a preexisting condition he regularly suffers from. Beach was prescribed a standard course of antibiotics which is not a treatment for COVID-19, and he was cleared to continue the duties of his office.

I know these have been tough times for so many, kids are home, daily lives have been disrupted, some loved ones can‚Äôt be seen in person, elderly homes can‚Äôt be visited, most of us are yearning for community interaction.

We will get through this together, don‚Äôt let anyone tell you different! While the whole of our nation has not been called upon to sacrifice together in a long time, an undeterred, indomitable, and unbeatable spirit runs through our American bloodlines. 

And while the country has had this ugly and unpredictable virus forced upon us, most of the country is slowly rising to President Kennedy‚Äôs profound words of ‚ÄúAsk not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country‚Äù.

Our Hampton Roads community understands sacrifice. For two straight decades, when something has happened in the world, anywhere in the world, and mother freedom needed to be defended, it has been our men and women, a large part of the less than one percent of this nation who have run forward to the sound of the fight. They are who has picked up the slack and shouldered the nation‚Äôs burden of sacrifice and service, it is our neighbors who pitch in to help with the kids or the yard work or the coaching of sports teams.

There is a generation raised in adversity, tempered by recession and war, proud of our American heritage, unwilling to sit back and watch the decline and division of this nation, preserving its providential promise to free people. I‚Äôm betting on them.

Now, a weary community, commonwealth, and country will have to rise to the occasion, brush off comfort for hardship, whatever the cost, to win this war against this invisible foe, and win we shall. 

There are new frontlines. Every American, who has been given the privilege of his or her citizenship is part of a selective service for our nation. It makes me proud that our brave healthcare providers are risking their lives every hour of every day in this conflict. 

Countless folks are posting on social media, offering to help others, Truck drivers keep driving, shelf stockers keep stocking, cooks keep cooking, dishwashers keep washing, first responders never stop responding, manufactures are retooling to provide medical masks, distilleries are creating hand sanitizer.  Volunteers are feeding families, teachers are helping stressed parents make sure their children continue to learn. Americans are resilient. 

The blunt fact is that all of us have been affected. Indeed, there will be some fundamental changes in this nation, some of us will be more affected directly or indirectly, we must remember that staying calm is as contagious as being fearful. Our triumph over this foe must not be impeded by selfish leaders in Washington, it must not be impeded by those who seek political gain rather than fixing an issue, it must not be impeded by citizens who take more than they need at the expense of our neighbors. 

I know that our American soldiers, our American workers, and our American business owner will continue to pull together and rise to this challenge now facing our nation with dogged persistence, just as our forefathers always have and we will emerge from this period as free people who are stronger and ready to forge our bright future.

"While our temporary routines are adapting to discomfort and social distancing, measures which we know can slow the steep curve of the spread, it is always important to remember we must stay calm and carry on during this crisis.  Curbing the spread of the virus will help ensure our health system and our healthcare providers on the front lines do not become overburdened as we have seen in other countries. Check out the link below to get a visual model explaining what how social distancing can help:

As we make these temporary and necessary adjustments to our lives, let us not forget the less fortunate amongst us. Our Foodbanks are often stressed under normal circumstances, and with all the school/work closures, this strain will only increase. If you have a little extra, please give a little extra: www.foodbankonline.org. 

Local, small businesses and our tourism industry are being hit hard ‚Äî which means so our our neighbors whose income rely on them. Consider purchasing gift cards and take out if you can. Also, let‚Äôs all make sure we are checking in (via phone/internet) on our elderly and vulnerable population, maybe getting essential items for them so those at higher risk of contracting serious, threatening symptoms can stay home. 

Too many citizens and positional leaders are looking at this crisis through a political lens. This is not the time for finger pointing.  This is the time for calm, collective, and decisive action, even if criticized. Dealing with an unpredictable and networked threat is tough for governments, companies, and people in understanding the best ways to meet the challenge within the framework they find themselves in.

Shutting down travel from China a couple months ago, and then travel from Europe (which became the epicenter), was a tough and burdensome measure. But that distancing has bought the United States time ‚Äî lowering the curve of cases and saving lives. At the same time, this crisis has exposed gaps in our systems, supply chains, diagnostic testing, and inflexible bureaucracies.  We must do better, but‚Ä¶more on that later. 

In the meantime, please continue to monitor official sources, updated with recommendations and information from experts:

"Huge thanks to the over 1000 neighbors who showed up at events across the district to, literally, endorse this campaign. Thank you! I look forward, with your help, to winning this district back and serving and representing you once more! üëäüá∫üá∏

On Tuesday, March 10th at noon, the Taylor for Congress 2020 committee filed for Scott Taylor to appear on the ballot as candidate for Virginia‚Äôs Second Congressional District.  This filing applies for ballot access for the Republican Primary on June 9th 2020. 

The campaign has received the endorsements of GOP leaders and local citizens alike.  House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy named Scott Taylor to the Young Guns program, identifying Taylor as representing the conservative values and being the most competitive candidate to win back the district for Republicans.  Scott Taylor‚Äôs supporters have come out in force to numerous events hosted throughout the 2nd District.  The grassroots support for Taylor to win the Republican Primary and General Elections is evidenced by the momentum in the local community, complemented by national-level GOP attention. Well over 1,000 voters from all over the district showed up to sign and put Taylor back on the ballot.  

Taylor commented, ‚ÄúI am humbled and fired up by the support of our community.  My passion for the prosperity and welfare of my constituency is exactly why I am back in this race.  The endorsement and support of experienced, senior leaders of the GOP demonstrates our ability to execute a win ‚Äì in June and November.
