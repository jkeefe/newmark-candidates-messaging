"Cincinnatians deserve a representative who will fight for them and their families each and every day in Washington. And Steve Chabot is not that. He’s built his 20-year career on nearly $6 million in corporate PAC money -- it’s no wonder he sides with special interests over our families.

As a lifelong Cincinnatian, I have a bold vision and strong will to fight hard for this city that I love. We have a real opportunity to flip this swing seat, send Steve into retirement, and start making real progress in Ohio, but I need your help. Please chip in today and be a part of this movement.

"With less than six weeks until the Primary Election, the far-right special interests backing Steve Chabot are panicking: filling Cincinnati’s airwaves, internet, and mailboxes to mislead voters  about his dismal record on prescription drugs.

We know the truth, but it’s going to take all of us doing our part to fight back against the dark money pouring in to prop-up Chabot’s campaign. . That’s why I’m asking you to step up and join me in this fight to flip this swing seat and retire Steve Chabot.»"
"Voters deserve to hear the truth, but the dark money-funded ads supporting Steve Chabot are not it. With just weeks until the Primary Election, the far-right special interests backing Chabot have already spent thousands on misleading ads trying to cover up his record on prescription drugs.

"When Illinoisans needed help, Sean Casten turned his back on us to benefit himself. He tried to get millions of our tax dollars for green energy companies that he’s invested in, and that’s just wrong.#AllIn4Ives"
"Sean Casten and the Democrats used the CARES Act to try and advance their radical agenda. They held up emergency relief to pack the bill with billions of your tax dollars for their pet projects.
#AllIn4Ives"
"When Rep. Sean Casten (IL-06) said his top priorities are, “Climate Change, Climate Change and Climate Change,” he wasn’t joking. In the heat of negotiations over the COVID-19 emergency relief bill, Casten didn’t stand up for the small business owners in Downtown Wheaton, Downers Grove, or Palatine who were just weeks from going out of business. He didn’t stand up for unemployed workers in Algonquin or Barrington who had no idea how they would pay their rent or mortgage on April 1. And he didn’t use his time composing a letter on behalf of minimum wage workers throughout the district struggling to pay their bills.

Instead, on March 20, Casten and 8 other US Representatives signed a letter to Nancy Pelosi and House leaders (pictured below) pushing for additional special subsidies and tax deals for the Green Energy industry – a sector that is already heavily subsidized. To be clear, there was already relief in the COVID-19 emergency bill for the essential services mentioned in the letter. Casten and his associates were asking for additional carve-outs and credits for their pet projects. 

More importantly, it is a sector in which Sean Casten is personally invested, via a company called Greenleaf Power, LLC. According to a RollCall.com article, “The company that operates the Plainfield facility for Greenleaf sells electricity and renewable-energy credits.” By virtue of extending those credits, Greenleaf and its investors would profit."
"For Immediate Release: 

In the midst of the  COVID-19 pandemic, Rep. Sean Casten (IL-06) released a series of attacks on his political opponents.

Ives, on the other hand, is focused on the nation’s problem-solving, independent spirit. It is that spirit that has seen America through crisis before, and will again. 

This morning, she released a new digital ad Lives On, which illustrates her campaign theme: that Americans have the ingenuity, compassion and grit to solve even our toughest challenges by working together."
"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/21/us/from-private-ordeal-to-national-fight-the-case-of-terri-schiavo.html

March 31st was the fifteen year anniversary of the starvation and dehydration death of Terri Schiavo. Terri’s tragic case was national news for many days as Americans watched her slowly die in a St. Petersburg, FL hospital. Terri, age 42, was in a long-term vegetative state, but could respond to people. Her loving parents and brother vigorously attempted to take her home and care for her, but her husband claimed that she would have preferred to, in fact, die. Challenged in court several times, Florida law repeatedly gave the husband the legal authority to act on behalf of his disabled wife. The Florida Legislature and the US Congress both acted passing laws to protect Terri, but the courts over-ruled them.

America watched and waited. With each passing day, Terri got weaker and weaker from lack of food and water. Finally, Terri’s weakened body succumbed and her devoted family buried their daughter and sister knowing the pain and suffering she endured in her final days.  

Being pro-life means standing up for those that cannot stand up for themselves, from conception through natural death. This was voted on in the United States Congress and all of America watched. I would have voted in Congress to save Terri.

Mike Beehler will be your PRO-LIFE CHAMPION."

"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

 In a Twitter rant this morning, Rep. Sean Casten (IL-06) accuses almost everyone for making the COVID-19 crisis worse. In the thread, he casts blame on the President, the media, social media platforms, social media users, and - despite repeatedly claiming his rant was non-political - Republicans, the Koch Brothers and the NRA. 

“These tweets are appalling. Blaming the world for problems instead of working to solve them shows us Sean Casten’s true character,” said Jeanne Ives, Republican nominee for Congress (IL-06) “Over the past two weeks, we have seen families and neighbors finding new and creative ways to look out for each other. I have talked with business owners in anguish  - not over their own circumstances, but over the uncertainty their employees are now faced with. We have seen doctors, nurses and infectious disease experts working overtime to help meet the needs in their communities. 

“People are working together to find solutions that will make life better, and to make the best of an unprecedented and stressful situation. We expect our elected representatives to do the same. But, in a moment that leaders should be using their platforms to promote solutions and safety, Sean Casten stokes anger, fear, division and bitterness. Capitalizing on a crisis is a cynical political move. The people of the Sixth District deserve better - and are better - than this.”

"Senator Brandon Beach announced Wednesday evening that he had been informed by his doctor that he tested positive for COVID-19 on. Beach immediately informed his colleagues and followed all guidelines set forth by Governor Kemp, the CDC, and other health officials. Unfortunately, some have decided to misrepresent the facts in a blatant and ugly effort to cause political harm to Senator Beach.

Certain individuals with their own political agenda have misrepresented the timeline of events and the facts about the health of Senator Beach leading up to the diagnosis.

Beach said: “Here are the facts: on Saturday, March 14th, I was cleared by my doctor to resume my official duties and presented with no reason to believe I had COVID-19 or any other serious illness. I followed the advice of my doctor that did not include actions such as quarantine related to the treatment of COVID-19. It is disappointing that some have chosen to misrepresent and manipulate the facts regarding private conversations I had with my doctor. It is outrageous and cowardly to allege that I would intentionally put my colleagues, friends, staff, and family at risk of contracting this virus.”

He continued: “In a time of crisis, some choose to make false accusations and spread untruths. But it is wrong and harmful to make assumptions about an individual’s health or medical conditions before knowing all the facts.”.

Beach reported that he went to a doctor on Saturday for complications from a preexisting condition he regularly suffers from. Beach was prescribed a standard course of antibiotics which is not a treatment for COVID-19, and he was cleared to continue the duties of his office. Beach was then surprised to learn on Wednesday that he tested positive for coronavirus and immediately took all necessary precautions, informing everyone he had been in contact with. Senator Beach is now at home and will undergo a self-quarantine."

"Read my full response to this evening's State of the Union Address:

For Immediate Release

February 4, 2020 - President Donald Trump addressed Congress this evening, delivering his third State of the Union address since he took office in 2017.

The President spoke of ""the great American comeback,” highlighting key election year accomplishments including US economic and military strength.

Jeanne Ives, a candidate for US Congress (IL-06), issued the following statement in response:

“To some degree, we knew that the President would use his State of the Union address to spike the ball a bit on his economic and military successes. Rightly so. From judicious trade deals to strong job growth, the president’s policies have helped to deliver more opportunities for American families than we have seen since Ronald Reagan. He doubled down on the need to protect our health care system from the ravages of socialism. And, of course, I appreciated the president’s recognition of military families and military operations.

“But what was unexpected about his speech was the tone. These are polarizing times. And the president typically plays to his base. Tonight, he rose above just his own base with a broader message. He talked about a blue collar boom; he talked about inclusiveness; he recognized General Charles McGee, a Tuskegee Airman, civil rights, Martin Luther King, Jr., Selma, historically black colleges and universities, Frederick Douglass and Harriett Tubman. He talked about the demand for school choice programs and was generous with Congress - giving them credit for the role they played in recent economic successes.

“The President’s optimism made Democrats look particularly small, as they refused to stand for increased employment rates in Black communities and among women, for American heroes being recognized, or for a young girl who finally would be able to attend the school of her family’s choice. Perhaps, most immaturely, Speaker Pelosi ripped up her copy of the speech before she left the dias like a child having a tantrum.

“We have to get past this. In 2018, one of the most bitterly partisan Congresses America has ever known was swept into office. It is time to put aside personality, and work together to move the country forward. We have a lot to do - especially in the field of health care, immigration and national security. There is common ground to be found. Stone-walling for political gain will only delay much needed solutions.

“As a Congresswoman, I will work with the president and reasonable colleagues in the US House regardless of party, so that we can continue to build on the pro-growth policy successes that are strengthening our economy and helping more Americans achieve their dreams.”

###"

"I ACCEPT  -- A lot has happened since I last stood before you, either as your state party chairman or as a delegate to the RNC convention in 2016, where I would vote to nominate one of the most dynamic and important presidents in American history. 

America has been through an unprecedented time of growth and prosperity where our standing in the world, from improved trade deals to the regrowth of manufacturing to strengthening our military, have positioned us for one of the best decades in our history.

And now we find ourselves with perhaps our greatest challenge as a nation. The America I know and love is rising to the occasion once again to address this virus, the loss of jobs and the fears we have about the economy. I know we will come back.

I see it happening in Colorado communities as we work together in ways we have never before. My confidence in America; my optimism about our future has not changed.

I proudly accept the nomination to represent my Colorado neighbors and to serve honorably in the United States Congress, to uphold our values and to always protect both our citizens and the rights inscribed within the U.S. Constitution. 

God bless Colorado and may God continue to bless America!

Excellent news!

"After the U.S. Senate worked through the weekend on a bipartisan stimulus package that would bring much-needed resources to American workers and businesses,  Nancy Pelosi parachuted into Washington after a week-long vacation to tank the bill.

The refusal to act swiftly by Democrats like Nancy Pelosi and Jason Crow has delayed America’s measured response to the impacts of the coronavirus.

—> This is America’s moment to lead with Hope! 

For instance, just this coming week, doctors and researchers will begin testing two promising new COVID-19 treatments — Hydroxy Chloroquine and Erythromycin. 

We should all pray the results mirror what has been seen in other countries — because it would change the curve of this virus and bring America the victory we need right now. 

Politicizing public health at a time of emergency — at the potential cost of lives and family paychecks — is never an example of true leadership or humanity.

"While many of our neighbors are concerned about their immediate family’s health or the health of elderly friends and family members, there are also new fears surrounding the uncertainty of the loss of jobs, our nation’s financial markets and businesses. 

While these are real concerns, we are also experiencing an unprecedented moment when our neighbors are supporting each other, employers are caring for their staffs and Colorado families are spending time at home caring and praying for one another. 

We are also witness to the reinvention of America’s culture of rapid solutions. Meeting and exceeding the need to defeat any foe, problem or healthcare challenge is simply what America does well.  

From the Greatest Generation mobilizing our nation to crush fascism, to sending a man to the moon and returning him safely to earth, to being the first nation in history to recognize that it’s citizen’s Rights and Liberty are granted by God and no man. 

Yes, many of our fellow Coloradans are concerned and possibly afraid — but this a moment that we Americans have experienced, met and overcome before.  I believe we will again. 

And I also believe in US!"

"While the coronavirus is a serious health concern, the United States and President Trump are correct to calm panic while also preparing for the spread of this contagious and possibly deadly flu-like illness. 

I believe, it’s important to manage any potential crisis — without making a crisis happen through political dissension.  A time of crisis is not just a time of anxiety and worry...  It gives us a chance to choose well. 

The president is correct to restrict travel into the U.S. — a decision that possibly saved untold numbers from contracting this illness, a step that bought us time to understand this virus and plan for ways to avoid it becoming a crisis here. 

At this critical time, I ask leadership on both sides of the aisle to disdain the opportunity to criticize —> and instead be real leaders who contribute to the solution instead of putting American’s at risk for their own political gain."

In less than four months we have raised a total of $500,159.25.

And while Coloradans waited for their freshman Congressman to address their immediate need for affordable healthcare, protection from illegal opioids being sold to their children, affordable education reforms and assistance in addressing Colorado’s faltering infrastructure – The House campaign collected $298,018.69 in big and small donations in the 4th quarter from frustrated and angry voters.

"They hate the president more than… EVERYTHING ELSE? 

It appears that Jason Crow, Nancy Pelosi, Adam Schiff and other House Democrats hate President Donald Trump more than protecting Americans from illegal and dangerous opioids that are killing thousands of Americans each year? 

The Department of Justice is warning that Crow, Pelosi and House Democrats are risking American lives if they don’t hurry up in extending a ban on knockoffs of the deadly synthetic opioid fentanyl.

The extended ban, which was passed unanimously in the Senate, would expire Feb. 6 if the House doesn’t act.

Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, the ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, is now urgently accusing Jason Crow and House Democrats of prioritizing impeachment over addressing the danger posed by fentanyl -- which is blamed for an overwhelming number of overdoses in the U.S. last year.

“Each year, millions of families and communities across the nation lose loved ones at the hands of the opioid crisis,” Rep. Collins said in a recent interview. “Failing to extend the ban of this dangerous drug will put countless lives at risk, which is why Congress must act now. I’m calling on Chairman Nadler and Speaker Pelosi to bring this bill to the floor for a vote immediately.”"

"I wanted write a quick message to you, my neighbors, my community, my countrymen and women.

I know these have been tough times for so many, kids are home, daily lives have been disrupted, some loved ones can’t be seen in person, elderly homes can’t be visited, most of us are yearning for community interaction.

We will get through this together, don’t let anyone tell you different! While the whole of our nation has not been called upon to sacrifice together in a long time, an undeterred, indomitable, and unbeatable spirit runs through our American bloodlines. 

And while the country has had this ugly and unpredictable virus forced upon us, most of the country is slowly rising to President Kennedy’s profound words of “Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country”.

Our Hampton Roads community understands sacrifice. For two straight decades, when something has happened in the world, anywhere in the world, and mother freedom needed to be defended, it has been our men and women, a large part of the less than one percent of this nation who have run forward to the sound of the fight. They are who has picked up the slack and shouldered the nation’s burden of sacrifice and service, it is our neighbors who pitch in to help with the kids or the yard work or the coaching of sports teams.

There is a generation raised in adversity, tempered by recession and war, proud of our American heritage, unwilling to sit back and watch the decline and division of this nation, preserving its providential promise to free people. I’m betting on them.

Now, a weary community, commonwealth, and country will have to rise to the occasion, brush off comfort for hardship, whatever the cost, to win this war against this invisible foe, and win we shall. 

There are new frontlines. Every American, who has been given the privilege of his or her citizenship is part of a selective service for our nation. It makes me proud that our brave healthcare providers are risking their lives every hour of every day in this conflict. 

Countless folks are posting on social media, offering to help others, Truck drivers keep driving, shelf stockers keep stocking, cooks keep cooking, dishwashers keep washing, first responders never stop responding, manufactures are retooling to provide medical masks, distilleries are creating hand sanitizer.  Volunteers are feeding families, teachers are helping stressed parents make sure their children continue to learn. Americans are resilient. 

The blunt fact is that all of us have been affected. Indeed, there will be some fundamental changes in this nation, some of us will be more affected directly or indirectly, we must remember that staying calm is as contagious as being fearful. Our triumph over this foe must not be impeded by selfish leaders in Washington, it must not be impeded by those who seek political gain rather than fixing an issue, it must not be impeded by citizens who take more than they need at the expense of our neighbors. 

I know that our American soldiers, our American workers, and our American business owner will continue to pull together and rise to this challenge now facing our nation with dogged persistence, just as our forefathers always have and we will emerge from this period as free people who are stronger and ready to forge our bright future.  

Your humble servant, Scott Taylor"
"If delaying Ukraine aid was an impeachable offense, what is it when you delay American aid? Elaine Luria for Congress, asking for a friend?

While thousands of our neighbors await vital aid, Luria doesn't stand up to Pelosi to help them. I understand, she has taken and will take millions from Pelosi controlled groups, what a shame. I will never stop fighting for you."
"Elaine Luria for Congress, Do you support holding up vital help for Virginians/Americans, unless unrelated items like green tax credits, emission restrictions, conditioning business loans on minimum wage/permanent paid leave, collective bargaining, and $ for Planned Parenthood are in the bill addressing the current national crisis? If not, what are you doing about it?"

Let's help our small businesses any way we can during this crisis.  Gift cards are a great way to help them bridge the gap.
Accurate information is key during this crisis.  Please make sure you are checking on official updates from organizations like the CDC and the Virginia Department of Health.
"Where is Elaine Luria?? There should be nothing in this American aid package that doesn't directly help our people. Pelosi's house is holding Americans hostage. No green tax credits, no emission standards, and no labor union paybacks. Luria is abdicating her duty for fight for us and is failing  in leadership. Not only has she voted with Pelosi 98% of the time, but when everyday Virginians are hurting, more and more unemployed, and small businesses are strained or on life support she is nowhere to be found and certainly not standing up to Pelosi. She is not at all who she said she was, and exactly who we said she was."

"While our temporary routines are adapting to discomfort and social distancing, measures which we know can slow the steep curve of the spread, it is always important to remember we must stay calm and carry on during this crisis.  Curbing the spread of the virus will help ensure our health system and our healthcare providers on the front lines do not become overburdened as we have seen in other countries. Check out the link below to get a visual model explaining what how social distancing can help: 
https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/?fbclid=IwAR3iESOIjMUhzg4QmuLfaTiNcuCrCo4NiDTwV490XQHH0zTacATU8o5P-jI

As we make these temporary and necessary adjustments to our lives, let us not forget the less fortunate amongst us. Our Foodbanks are often stressed under normal circumstances, and with all the school/work closures, this strain will only increase. If you have a little extra, please give a little extra: www.foodbankonline.org. 

Local, small businesses and our tourism industry are being hit hard — which means so our our neighbors whose income rely on them. Consider purchasing gift cards and take out if you can. Also, let’s all make sure we are checking in (via phone/internet) on our elderly and vulnerable population, maybe getting essential items for them so those at higher risk of contracting serious, threatening symptoms can stay home. 

Too many citizens and positional leaders are looking at this crisis through a political lens. This is not the time for finger pointing.  This is the time for calm, collective, and decisive action, even if criticized. Dealing with an unpredictable and networked threat is tough for governments, companies, and people in understanding the best ways to meet the challenge within the framework they find themselves in.

Shutting down travel from China a couple months ago, and then travel from Europe (which became the epicenter), was a tough and burdensome measure. But that distancing has bought the United States time — lowering the curve of cases and saving lives. At the same time, this crisis has exposed gaps in our systems, supply chains, diagnostic testing, and inflexible bureaucracies.  We must do better, but…more on that later.

"Huge thanks to the over 1000 neighbors who showed up at events across the district to, literally, endorse this campaign. Thank you! I look forward, with your help, to winning this district back and serving and representing you once more! 👊🇺🇸

On Tuesday, March 10th at noon, the Taylor for Congress 2020 committee filed for Scott Taylor to appear on the ballot as candidate for Virginia’s Second Congressional District.  This filing applies for ballot access for the Republican Primary on June 9th 2020. 

The campaign has received the endorsements of GOP leaders and local citizens alike.  House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy named Scott Taylor to the Young Guns program, identifying Taylor as representing the conservative values and being the most competitive candidate to win back the district for Republicans.  Scott Taylor’s supporters have come out in force to numerous events hosted throughout the 2nd District.  The grassroots support for Taylor to win the Republican Primary and General Elections is evidenced by the momentum in the local community, complemented by national-level GOP attention. Well over 1,000 voters from all over the district showed up to sign and put Taylor back on the ballot.  

Taylor commented, “I am humbled and fired up by the support of our community.  My passion for the prosperity and welfare of my constituency is exactly why I am back in this race.  The endorsement and support of experienced, senior leaders of the GOP demonstrates our ability to execute a win – in June and November. Now that we’re officially on the ballot, the work of sharing our positive message far and wide continues to ramp up.”"

✅21: The average pay gap in this country. On average, women earn $0.79 to every man’s $1.

"~ National Debt

Did you know that paying interest on the National Debt is a 'mandatory' expense in our annual Federal budget? When Congress writes a proposed annual budget, it MUST include National Debt interest payments. Exactly how much money are we talking about?

For fiscal year 2020 (October 1, 2019 - September 30, 2020) that amount is $479 billion.

479 BILLION dollars

1/2 a TRILLION dollars

for the annual INTEREST payment 

What could America do with that wasted 1/2 Trillion dollars?

~ Infrastructure?
~ Border Security?
~ Cyber Security?
~ Improved Veteran Benefits?
~ Tax Cuts?

Instead, they're essentially throwing away hard earned American tax payer dollars. Does it infuriate you? It infuriates me. 

It's past time to get our House in order.

"This is a picture of my identical twin daughters after they were born by emergency c-section at 35 weeks gestation. Theirs was a rare type of identical twin pregnancy called “mono-amniotic.” Simply, they shared one sac and one placenta - and because there was nothing to separate them in-vitro, their umbilical cords tangled as the pregnancy progressed. They spent a month in the NICU before coming home. Today, they are 20 years old. They are beautiful, healthy and thriving. Like all of my children, they have been an immeasurable joy and blessing in my life. 

Recently, I had the opportunity to watch the documentary, “One Child Nation,” about the law put into place by China from 1979 to 2015 to limit their population growth. I remember learning about this “policy” in junior high/high school and didn’t think too hard about what such a policy actually meant. I didn’t think about forced sterilizations. I didn’t think about forced abortions - including late term. I didn’t think about infanticide. When I was a young girl, I naively thought people just willingly complied. It didn’t occur to me that women were rounded-up like animals.

I most definitely didn’t think about babies thrown into dumpsters, landfills or tossed along the side of the road in bags labeled “medical waste.” I didn’t think about girls being discarded because males were preferred in the Asian culture. And I never considered the human trafficking aspect.

As your Congresswoman, I pledge to protect the most vulnerable among us. Babies aren’t “medical waste.” Children aren’t refuse. We have an obligation to be the voice for those who cannot speak for themselves.

Elaine Luria is not at all who she said she was, and exactly who we said she was. 

Candidate Luria said she was a moderate, but then voted and supported: 

— Free healthcare for illegal immigrants, funded by taxpayers 
— Gun bans and other anti-2nd amendment measures
— Abortions until birth
— Impeachment of President Trump, disgracefully using her uniform to justify a call to impeach before seeing one piece of evidence

Candidate Luria would not tell us whether she planned to vote for Pelosi, but her record now speaks for her: 

— Luria immediately voted for Pelosi for Speaker 
— She quickly became Pelosi’s puppet, voting with her leader 98% of the time
— She prioritizes partisan games over advocacy for our citizens 

We know that record does not represent us here in Hampton Roads. Elaine Luria was elected to Congress in a fluke. She must go, and we need YOUR help to retire her!

Worse, they want to make millions of Virginians criminals if they don't turn in magazines with capacities over 12 rounds by next January. This is theft of property by our government. It doesn't make anyone safer, as there is zero evidence of that. It's unfair, unjust, and unconstitutional. We will not comply, do not tread on us.

characteristic of like kind as enumerated in clauses (i) through (x).
3. A semi-automatic center-fire pistol that expels single or multiple projectiles by action of an
explosion of a combustible material with a fixed magazine capacity in excess of 12 rounds;
4.

explosion of a combustible material; or

"A recent poll indicated 57% of Utahns opposed the Senate voting to convict President Trump, yet Senator Romney voted to convict him anyway. Today, he cared more about 43% of the people than even the 47% he said he didn’t care about in 2012.

I’m running for Congress because Utahns know their voice isn’t being heard.

"Voters deserve to hear the truth, but the dark money-funded ads supporting Steve Chabot are not it. With just weeks until the Primary Election, the far-right special interests backing Chabot have already spent thousands on misleading ads trying to cover up his record on prescription drugs. 

Bottom line: Steve Chabot votes in favor of big pharma, not Ohio families. 

We can send a bold advocate for Cincinnati’s families to Congress -- but I need your help to make sure voters know what’s at stake in this election. Please chip in today and be a part of this movement.»"

"Below are answers to the questions I’m most frequently asked. As always, please let me know your thoughts, and if you have additional questions let me know those, too, and I’ll gladly author another post to answer them. Thank you!

~ Standing with our President
I am THE candidate in this race who has supported President Trump from the very beginning. You can count on me to stand with our President in Congress and ensure that he has a true ally in Utah.

~ America First
I'm tired of career politicians putting themselves ahead of our country. I will always put America first in everything I do in Congress. Our country is the greatest in the world, and we owe it to future generations to Keep America Great.

~ Second Amendment
The Founders understood that the right to keep and bear arms is essential for a free society to remain a free society. You have my word that as your Representative in Congress I will never allow the Left to weaken our Second Amendment rights.

~ Immigration
A country without secure borders is not a strong country. In addition to border security, we need productive legal immigration reform while holding accountable those who choose to break our laws.

~ Socialism
The Left is waging the greatest assault on capitalism, personal responsibility, and liberty that we've seen in decades. Socialism has been completely disproven as a system of government. I will lead the charge to defend the ideas and principles that have made us the most prosperous country in history. Capitalism has lifted more people out of poverty than any other system that’s been tried.

~ Healthcare
Obamacare continues to fail America. Healthcare remains too expensive, and while we have President Trump to thank for eliminating the unconstitutional individual mandate, we still have work to do to increase choice, reduce costly regulations, make prescription medication more affordable for Americans, and lower expenses for working families and businesses.

~ Protecting Life
Without the right to life, none of our other rights can be enjoyed. In Congress I will stand up for the unborn and be an advocate to protect the most vulnerable among us.

~ The Economy
President Trump's leadership has given us the strongest economy in American history, with record low unemployment, rising wages, and a roaring stock market. Yet the Left seems intent on destroying that progress and sending us back into recession with their big government policies. I will be a voice in Congress against failed socialist ideas and defend the proven free market principles America was built on.

~ Our Constitution
Our rights as humans are inalienable, granted by God, and protected by the U.S. Constitution. In Congress, I will never allow our precious Constitutional rights to be infringed upon in any fashion.

As always, fundraising is critically important. If you believe in me and want to bring about a needed CD4 course correction, please chip in today. No amount is too small. https://secure.winred.com/kathleen-for-utah/donate"

"Let's address the elephant in the room. I get asked a variation of this question often:

""Kathleen, are you a Trump supporter?"" or ""Kathleen, how can you support someone like Donald Trump? He says such awful things. His mannerisms are crass. His tweets are below the dignity of the office of President. He isn’t Presidential. He’s an embarrassment.""

I’ve heard it all.

At one time or another, I’ve thought it all.

And yet, here I am still supporting him and planning to vote for him for a second term.

When DJT came onto the scene, descending the escalator, I was immediately drawn to his candidacy. He didn’t act or talk like a politician. He wasn’t condescending in his speech. He was matter of fact. More than that, he was saying aloud things I’d thought to myself for years, and I found myself, over and over, saying “Yes! Exactly!” His message resonated with me. He was putting into words the frustration I’d been feeling with government for decades. And I wasn’t alone in my reaction to his message.

Although I’ve lived in Utah the past 35 years, I have many friends and family who live in other States - States that are primarily back East. For years, I’ve listened to them express frustration regarding their economies - the loss of industries, jobs, etc... I knew that people were feeling desperate, and that they’d not been the recipients of the “hope and change” they’d been promised the preceding 8 years under the Obama administration. They were tired of empty promises made from the mouths of polished smooth talking politicians.

How many times does one fall for empty promises before a new kind of candidate comes onto the scene and instantly gets their attention?

So suddenly, a non politician - a businessman - someone who wasn’t an ideologue - was running for President. He didn’t use big words. In fact, he used very small words because he’d learned early on as a businessman that success is instantly limited when you talk down to people.

How many politicians fall into the category of arrogance and condescension? Many - probably most, actually. People across this Nation were tired of it. I was tired of it.

Now, a basic speaking-level candidate was offering easily understood solutions to the economy - answers to jobs that had been lost. That message spoke very loudly to those without jobs and who'd been unable to put food on their tables at night. His message especially spoke to those whose entire industries had been obliterated through decades of losing jobs overseas or across our country’s borders. This unlikely candidate was talking about bringing back jobs, fair trade practices, eliminating unfair tariffs and promising to put America first, and Americans back to work.

How did the Left respond?

They called him a racist, a xenophobe, a nationalist and soon began the comparisons to Hitler. Next, they insulted and belittled this man’s supporters. They, too, were called names: racists, rednecks, uneducated, deplorables, etc...

It was ridiculous and the height of arrogance. Again.

He made promises that he’d protect religious freedom. He has. He said he’d secure our borders. He’s certainly tried to, but for some reason, the Left - the same Left that used to support secure borders and legal immigration - now opposes both.

Politics as usual. And who wins? Not Americans.

The campaign continued.

Did any of us ever think Trump was an angel, or worthy of ecclesiastical leadership? No. And that was before those awful comments aired on that TV program with Billy Bush. Was I offended? Absolutely. I was sick about it. It was indefensible.

So, what to do at that point? The messages of the other candidates didn’t resonate with me, and frankly, I didn’t think any of the other Republican candidates were electable. Plus, it was just more of the same ole, same ole, and I was beyond tired of that.

Did I think Hillary would defend religious liberty? No.
Did I think she’d put America first? No.
Did I think she’d bring back jobs? No.
Did I think she’d support our armed forces? No.
Did I think she’d champion our interests abroad? No, and especially not after Benghazi.
She’d already (before she was a candidate) dismissed women (like me) who had chosen to be stay at home mothers. She didn’t respect women like me. How could she ever represent a woman like me?
Did I expect her to protect the sanctity of life? No.
Did I expect her to appoint judges to the bench who would honor and respect the Constitution? No.

What about Evan McMullin? I don’t know anyone who took his candidacy seriously, and I wasn’t going to take my precious right to vote and treat it like a joke.

To me, the choice was clear: vote for the candidate who will promote, defend and honor the liberties this country was founded upon or risk turning the country over to just another smooth-talking politician whose motto was “Self before Country.”

No thank you. Been there, done that.

President Trump has kept his promises, and then some. He’s done things that many Republicans have often promised to do but didn’t:

He has defunded Planned Parenthood.
He officially recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and moved our embassy there.
Unemployment is the lowest in 51 years.
African-American unemployment the lowest ever recorded.
$1 Trillion in corporate money has been brought back to our shores.

This, and much more, despite relentless attempts to overthrow the election results of 2016 - the ultimate act of political arrogance.

No, I won’t defend Donald Trump’s crass words or actions, but I will support him - everyday - as President because his policies have been great for America.

It's an honor for me to be named to the National Republican Congressional Committee’s Young Guns program! Today's announcement validates the hard work we’re putting in every day, and will give us even more momentum as we strive to take back this seat from Ben McAdams.

"President Donald J. Trump has been communicating with the people of Iran in the Farsi language on social media. In addition, he has out-maneuvered the Iranian regime, but more importantly, he has done so without calling for a regime change. 

Killing Qassem Soleimani has put fear in the Ayatollah and the Mullah. When Soleimani was alive, the Iranian leadership disarmed the Iranian people and used force to instill fear and compliance. The Iranian women have been at the forefront of the horrific oppression.

Today, Iranian citizens are marching and protesting and demanding a regime change. THEY are demanding it, not the President of the United States. In response, President Trump has communicated directly to the Iranian people:

“To the brave and suffering people of Iran: I have been standing with you since the beginning of my presidential period and my government will still stand with you. We follow your protests very close. Your courage is inspiring.”

To the leaders of Iran, his message has been quite different:

“To the leaders of Iran - DO NOT KILL YOUR PROTESTORS. Thousands have already been killed or imprisoned by you, and the World is watching. More importantly, the USA is watching. Turn your internet back on and let reporters roam free! Stop the killing of your great Iranian people!”

The Muslim religion and radical Islam are NOT the same. Radical Islam, Marxism and Globalism share the similar goal of destroying the West. Their methodology is similar as well: destroy the Christian religion and destroy the family which is the basic unit of Western society.

The desire for freedom knows no borders. Iranians yearn to be free. It’s no different in Hong Kong. Sadly, they yearn for what far too many Americans take for granted: freedom, liberty and agency."
This is the official Facebook page of Kathleen for Utah. Kathleen Anderson is a Republican running for Congress in Utah's 4th Congressional District.
"For the past couple of days, the left has blamed President Donald J. Trump for the downed Ukrainian airliner that was struck by an Iranian missile. Essentially, they’ve said, “if Trump hadn’t taken out Qassem Soleimani, the Iranians wouldn’t have launched a missile that struck that plane.”

Their way of thinking reminds me of raising young children:

Me: “Why did you hit your sister?”
Child: “She made me do it! She told me I was ugly!”

It seemed those types of moments occurred daily in our home, but they allowed me the opportunity to teach my children about choice and accountability: You don’t get to blame your actions on someone else. You made the choice. You own it. No one made you do anything. You chose to hit your sister.

The left seems obsessed with the blame game. Everything is the fault of Donald Trump. 

Everything. 

Someone sent me a video clip today that was taken at a recent Trump rally. When a protestor interrupted the President and caused a distraction, the crowd began chanting, “USA! USA! USA!”

They did NOT chant, “Trump! Trump! Trump!”

Repeatedly on my wall, I’ve been called a Trump “bootlicker” by those who dislike our President. To me, it’s proof that the left absolutely doesn’t understand us. 

We worship God, not a President.

That said, however, we’re thankful to God for a President who loves this Nation, and who will fight to defend her, and to defend us and the Constitution from attacks on our freedoms and liberties.

May God bless America and our President.

"FUNDRAISING: I know this is a topic most don’t want to hear, but please read to the end.

I’m asking every person who has liked this page to donate $25 per month to my campaign through the June 23rd primary. That is six donations for a total of $150 per person. If this is beyond your household budget, I understand, but I’m asking you to go to your friends, family members and neighbors to raise that amount. 

If it’s important to you to:

1. Flip back CD4 to Republican; 
2. Make sure that Republican candidate is supportive of our President, and 
3. Regain a GOP House majority 

then it’s imperative that you understand the critical nature of grassroots donations in a campaign effort such as mine. 

I am not backed by Utah’s political establishment elite, nor Washington’s political establishment elite. As such, large donations are not in play for my candidacy - I am reliant upon your support. 

You and I are “we the people.” Please recognize what’s at stake, and to support me with your vote AND your donation. We are in this together. The election of President Donald J. Trump in 2016 proved that ‘the people’ can, will and prefer to elect candidates who are not backed by the establishment. Let’s do the same this year in Utah’s CD4.

So, what to do at that point? The messages of the other candidates didn’t resonate with me, and frankly, I didn’t think any of the other Republican candidates were electable. Plus, it was just more of the same ole, same ole, and I was beyond tired of that.

Did I think Hillary would defend religious liberty? No. 
Did I think she’d put America first? No. 
Did I think she’d bring back jobs? No. 
Did I think she’d support our armed forces? No. 
Did I think she’d champion our interests abroad? No, and especially not after Benghazi. 
She’d already (before she was a candidate) dismissed women (like me) who had chosen to be stay at home mothers. She didn’t respect women like me. How could she ever represent a woman like me?
Did I expect her to protect the sanctity of life? No. 
Did I expect her to appoint judges to the bench who would honor and respect the Constitution? No. 

What about Evan McMullin? I don’t know anyone who took his candidacy seriously, and I wasn’t going to take my precious right to vote and treat it like a joke.

To me, the choice was clear: vote for the candidate who will promote, defend and honor the liberties this country was founded upon or risk turning the country over to just another smooth-talking politician whose motto was “Self before Country.” 

No thank you. Been there, done that.

President Trump has kept his promises, and then some. He’s done things that many Republicans have often promised to do but didn’t:

He has defunded Planned Parenthood. 
He officially recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and moved our embassy there. 
Unemployment is the lowest in 51 years.
African-American unemployment the lowest ever recorded.
$1 Trillion in corporate money has been brought back to our shores.

This, and much more, despite relentless attempts to overthrow the election results of 2016 - the ultimate act of political arrogance.
 
No, I won’t defend Donald Trump’s crass words or actions, but I will support him - everyday - as President because his policies have been great for America.
